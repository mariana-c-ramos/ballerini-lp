**OVERVIEW:** Kept same structure, but did my own content - instead of her bot, I made my own.<br> 
**TOPICS STUDIED:** classes, flexbpx, hero sections.
I used my own photo for the bot and the text is different, but the content and structure I left it has it's shown on the tutorial.

What did I used to do this project:
1. Figma
2. VS Code
3. HTML
4. CSS
