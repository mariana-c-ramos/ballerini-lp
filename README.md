## My version of Ballerini's landing page!

In order to train flexbox and what I have been learning, I followed Rafa Ballerini's tutorial on how to do a landing page for a bot.

I used my own photo for the bot and the text is different, but the content and structure I left it has it's shown on the tutorial.

What did I used to do this project:
1. Figma
2. VS Code
3. HTML
4. CSS
